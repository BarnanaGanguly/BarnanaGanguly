📚 Bookworm Alert! 🚨
When I'm not diving into data or tinkering with algorithms, you can find me journeying through Middle Earth, dueling in the halls of Hogwarts, roaming the vast landscapes of Westeros, or venturing into galaxies far, far away. As C.S. Lewis once said, "You can never get a cup of tea large enough or a book long enough to suit me."
Here's a little fun fact: If I could have a Patronus, it would be a phoenix, symbolizing rebirth from data insights! 🦅
